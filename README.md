## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

    - Drag and drop didn't work for sometime. Solved it after watching a youtube video onlie. Titled as xcode 13 tutorial.
    - Downloading xcode took 3 hour.
    - updating my outdated Mac computer took quite a long time. (can not afford a new one).
    - Tried downloading xcode on window PC, but require virtual box, and afteward would be slower than my 4G MacBook Air.
    - Also some of the gif in the prework page, was from xcode from the version before and it had me confuse why some of the CGI was different.
    - It was fun building it, and I'm going to attempt to do the bonuses as well.
    - In addition, I did not understand half of the swift code I wrote within the tip calculator function, and why it worked. 
    - Is a little fast pace, but I think I can catch up.
